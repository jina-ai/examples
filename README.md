These examples showcase Jina in action and provide sample code for you to work from. We suggest you read [Jina 101](http://101.jina.ai) and <a href="https://jina.ai/2020/07/06/What-is-Neural-Search-and-Why-Should-I-Care.html">What is Neural Search?</a> to get a conceptual overview.

❗If you'd like to run our examples on Windows, please follow [this instruction](https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/install/os/on-wsl.html).

To learn more about how to use Jina, please refer to [our docs](http://www.jina.ai).

## Performance metrics

You can run the `perf-script.sh` in order to run all of the examples on your machine. Make sure this is done in a separate python virtualenv.

This measures QPS for indexing and querying.

This will store the results in [`performance.txt`](./performance.txt).

Note that a lot of the examples are not optimized (or configured for scaling). They are provided as is, for the basic functionality. 

## Adding Tests for Examples

You are highly encouraged to add a test for your example so that we will be alerted if it breaks in the future:

1. Put your test data in the `tests` folder. The test data can be a few text sentences, images or audio samples
2. Create `test_[your_example].py` in the `tests` folder. Add your test cases to the `tests` file with meaningful asserts depending on example input and output
3. Run the test locally to confirm before pushing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contents.html)
4. Add your example folder name to the `path` variable in `matrix` of `.github/worflows/ci.yml`. This will trigger your example test on creating a pull request.


### Testing Tips

- For reference, check out the `tests` folder from [South Park example](./southpark-search/tests) if your data is about text and [object search example](./object-search/tests) for images.
- Try using the original example function by importing them to the test. Avoid any modifications to original Flow or logic.
- Use the [pytest fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html) `tmpdir` for temporary directory
