These examples showcase Jina in action and provide sample code for you to work from. 

We suggest you read the following to get an overview of what Jina is and how it works:

- [What is neural search?](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/.github/2.0/neural-search.md)
- [Get started](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/#get-started) - especially the cookbooks for Document, Executor and Flow

## Performance metrics

You can run the `.github/perf-script.sh` in order to run all of the examples on your machine. Make sure this is done in a separate python virtualenv.

This measures QPS for indexing and querying.

This will store the results in [`.github/performance.txt`](./github/performance.txt).

Note that a lot of the examples are not optimized (or configured for scaling). They are provided as is, for the basic functionality. 

## Adding Tests for Examples

You are highly encouraged to add a test for your example so that we will be alerted if it breaks in the future:

1. Put your test data in the `tests` folder. The test data can be a few text sentences, images or audio samples
2. Create `test_[your_example].py` in the `tests` folder. Add your test cases to the `tests` file with meaningful asserts depending on example input and output
3. Run the test locally to confirm before pushing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contents.html)
4. Add your example folder name to the `path` variable in `matrix` of `.github/worflows/ci.yml`. This will trigger your example test on creating a pull request.


### Testing Tips

- For reference, check out the `tests` folder from [South Park example](./southpark-search/tests) if your data is about text and [object search example](./object-search/tests) for images.
- Try using the original example function by importing them to the test. Avoid any modifications to original Flow or logic.
- Use the [pytest fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html) `tmpdir` for temporary directory
