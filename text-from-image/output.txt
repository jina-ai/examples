Learning is one of the overcommunicated but underleveraged tools of the
common entrepreneur.

Everyone talks about methods of learning, but few people find realistic and
authentic techniques that actually yield a net profit in the information and
application categories.

Elon Musk has broken through that barrier with learning techniques that
have proven successful not just once, but time and time again.

A good argument could be made that Musk has leveraged his learning by
becoming a disruptor. He and his companies have shifted entire industries,
including the transportation sector, the energy sector, and the space sector.

He recently announced at a press conference that his plans for his biotech
company Neuralink are progressing quite nicely, hinting at yet another
sector which his hands will likely shift in the coming years.

Yes, Musk is a once-in-a-lifetime genius. Likely on the same levels as Nikola
Tesla, Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton. He has a different way of viewing
problems than the average entrepreneur.
