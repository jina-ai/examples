In this demo, we use Jina to build a language-agnostic semantic search system on the [WMTData](http://www.statmt.org/wmt13/dev.tgz). We'll try to search for a text in a language (say English), and try to find all relevant documents inclusive of all languages (French, Spanish etc.). The WMT data consists of Machine Translation in various languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Czech) for the years 2008-2012. There's a parallel corpora, which helps us test the search performance using Jina. This example is inspired from the [Bert Based NLP Semantic Search System example.](https://github.com/jina-ai/examples/tree/master/southpark-search)
