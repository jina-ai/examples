In this demo, we use Jina to build a vector search engine that finds the closest vector in the database to a query

This example uses [ANN_SIFT10K](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/), which is a dataset comprised of three vector sets:  

- 10K index
- 100 vectors query
- 25K vectors to train
  
These vectors are [SIFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform) descriptors for some image dataset. The example is easily adapted for use with larger datasets from the same source which can be found [here](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/). For this demo, a vector is considered to be a document and only one chunk per document is used.

In this example, we use Faiss and Annoy Indexer Vectors from the hub (https://hub.docker.com/r/jinahub/pod.indexer.faissindexer) (https://hub.docker.com/r/jinahub/pod.indexer.annoyindexer).

This example will show how the same index created with an index Flow can be used to be queried using different type of indexers.

This example also shows how to evaluate ranking results with the different indexers, and adds the search with NumpyIndexer (that uses exhaustive search) (close to 100% recall) to compare 

Before moving forward, we highly suggest completing/reviewing our lovely [Jina 101](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/tree/master/docs/chapters/101) and [Jina "Hello, World!"üëãüåç](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina#jina-hello-world-).

We encourage you to try different indexers and different options for other indexers to see what gets the best results and performance.

## Requirements

Be sure to create an environment with Python 3.7 or higher installed, then you also need to have the requirements of this example,
which is `jina` and `click`.

In order to run the example with the different indexers, make sure to pull the docker images from the [Jina Hub repository] (https://hub.docker.com/u/jinahub)

## Prepare the data

In order to get the data needed to run the example, we have prepared a small script that will download the required fails.

```bash
./get_siftsmall.sh
```

Moreover, FAISS needs to learn some structural patterns of the data in order to build an efficient indexing scheme. Usually, the training is done with some subset of data that is not necessarily part of the index.

Running these scripts will set you up the rest of the way for this example by:

1. downloading the ANN_SIFT10K dataset files and
2. generating a workspace folder where the training data will be stored

This workspace folder will contain the built index once the vectors are indexed and will be mapped to the docker image.

```bash
./generate_training_data.sh
```

## Define the Flows

### Index <!-- omit in toc -->

To index the data we first need to define our **Flow** and for this example we'll use a **YAML** file. In the Flow YAML file, we add **Pods** in sequence. In this demo, we have five pods defined:

- `crafter`
- `encoder`
- `indexer`

However, we have another Pod working in silence. Actually, the input to the very first Pod is always the Pod with the name of **gateway**, aka the "Forgotten" Pod. Most of the time, we can safely ignore the **gateway** because it essentially does the dirty work of orchestrating the work for the Flow.

<table style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
<tr>
<td> flow-index.yml</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
  <sub>

```yaml
!Flow
metas:
  prefetch: 10
pods:
  encoder:
    uses: yaml/encode.yml
    parallel: $JINA_PARALLEL
  indexer:
    uses: yaml/indexer.yml
    parallel: $JINA_PARALLEL
    timeout_ready: 10000
```
</sub>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Query <!-- omit in toc -->

Just as we need to index, we also need a Flow to process the request message during querying. The query flow looks very similar
to the index flow but with an extra pod used to evaluate results.

<table  style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
<tr>
<td> flow-query.yml</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
  <sub>

```yaml
!Flow
with:
  read_only: true
pods:
  encoder:
    uses: yaml/encode.yml
    parallel: $JINA_PARALLEL
  indexer:
    uses: $JINA_USES
    uses_internal: $JINA_USES_INTERNAL
    parallel: $JINA_PARALLEL
    timeout_ready: 600000
    #uses_after: _merge_matches  # uncomment this if you want to increase parallelization
    volumes: './workspace:/workspace/workspace'
  evaluate:
    uses: yaml/evaluate.yml
```

</sub>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

In this Flow, the `faiss_indexer` is the one that will do the nearest neighbours search from the given chunk (in this case, since every document has one chunk they are the same). Additionally, it will return the top_k most similiar documents in order of similiarity. Later, `doc_indexer` retrieves the actual document value from the Document Id.

## Run the Flows

### Index <!-- omit in toc -->

Index is run with the following command, where batch_size can be chosen by the user. Indexing reads a file of numpy arrays, and sends them to the flow gateway in binary mode to be converted back into numpy arrays by the crafter.

```bash
python app.py -t index -n $batch_size
```

### Query <!-- omit in toc -->

Query can be run with the following command, where index_type can be `annoy`, `faiss`, or `numpy`.
It is important to make sure that the environment variables in `app.py` are set to the right docker image tags that one wants to test.

```bash
python app.py -t query -i {index_type}
```

## Evaluation results

The results with the default parameters for Annoy, Faiss and NumpyIndexers are:

```bash
python app.py -t query -i numpy

Recall@100 => 99.47000050544739%
```

```bash
python app.py -t query -i faiss

Recall@100 => 47.16999990865588%
```

```bash
python app.py -t query -i annoy

Recall@100 => 77.69999986886978%
```

It can be good to look for different parameters to guarantee the best results

## Use Docker image from the jina hub

To make it easier for the user, we have built and published the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jinahub/app.example.advancedvectorsearch) with the indexed documents.
You can retrieve the docker image using:

```bash
docker pull jinahub/app.example.advancedvectorsearch:0.0.1-0.9.17
```
So you can pull from its latest tags. And you can run it. By default it runs the search with `faiss` indexer. 
If you want to run the image with `annoy` as a search library, you can override the entrypoint doing:

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash {DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG} entrypoint.sh annoy
```

## Wrap up

In this example we have seen how to use different indexers as vector databases and how to use a `ref_indexer` as a base indexer.
 We also have seen how to use a pod inside a docker container inside our index and query flows, and how to use evaluators to assess the quality 
 of our search system.

## Next Steps

Where to go from here? You can always try:  

- different kinds of inverted indices and options from FAISS or Annoy.
- other indexers.
- indexing larger datasets.

Finally, play around with different evaluation metrics.

**Enjoy Coding with Jina!**
