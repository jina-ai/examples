  # first pathway

    uses: pods/filter.yml
    env:

    needs: segment                          # for parallel sub-flows, we will add 'needs' for the starting pod of this sub-flow, and it should need the pod it follows
  - name: textSegmenter                     # we use another segmenter to segment text into smaller chunks (lines of text)
    uses: pods/segment-text-customized.yml

    uses: pods/encode-text.yml
  - name: chunkmetaIndexer                  # this is a important chunk level indexer, it will store the meta data of chunks, so during search we can find the data and add the data into results
    uses: pods/index-chunkmeta.yml
  - name: textModIndexerCC                  # here we index the chunks of chunks ('CC') text (lines), if we want to index higher chunk level, we need to add a new indexer and traversal_paths set to 'c'

  # second pathway, in parallel

    uses: pods/filter.yml
    env:
      filter_mime: image/png
    needs: segment                          # note that we need to add this for the parallel sub-flow

  # third pathway, in parallel

    needs: segment                          # still we need to 'needs' the segment pod
  # join all parallel works
  - name: joiner                            # in the end we combine the 3 sub-flows, we 'needs' the ending pod of each flow
