Take back the memories as you smile to hide the. Pain from me now. Shut down the curiosity that brings you here. Again. No sense of purity as you try to take the life. From me now. Nothing that you ever say could ever possibly. Erase. All the hateful things you did and now i'm. Through with you nothing you could ever say. Nothing you could ever say.

/3-doors-down/,Heaven,/3-doors-down/heaven.html,I got lost out there in this world. Looking for a brand new way to fall down. It's no surprise that things gotten worse. And I think God never let me drown. I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven - I just had to go home. While I was having the time of my life. I think my soul died a little every day. I always called to say I'm sorry. You said it's okay. But you should be through it all - you never walked away. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven - I just had to go home. Into the arms of my angel. Into the peace I left behind. All I had to do to save my own life. Was to look into your eyes. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I just had to go home. I just had to go home.

Crave material thangs and makin' slave wages. Baggy pockets only got laundry fluff. Livin' where rich people always buyin' some stuff. So you try to act tough and hide whats inside. Hold your head high gettin' fucked up and throwin' dice. As bad as yours and bad enough I'm sure. My heart wants to love but must navigate through war. Cuz seein' that we're wired to short circuit. Must mean the meek who will inherit the earth already work it. There's a land by the sand grab the money. Plastic the life end of the century. People actin' fake can't see the omens. Wake up yourself cause change is comin'. There's a land by the sand grab the money. Hollywood is such a place fuelin' the frenzy. And everybody starts to peep around corners. Before they take their next step they know their borders. In this $19.98 plus shipping and handling type. Netherworld everytime merchandise dips in our coffers. We buy that image that cost of livin' uh huh. The fakest shit and act cool our friends are watchin'. Attention shoppers check the selection in our reflection. Don't you feel good does it enhance your fresh complexion. You gotta have it you got got to have it (2x). As the world turns and all the money we burn. On the bullshit to make us happy sometimes we never learn. We're self centered we think were better. We look down as a people upon our elders. There's a land by the sand grab the money. Now let go of it cause it's dissolving. It created all your fears and kept you hustling. Made you sever all the ties to your family. There's a land by the sand grad the money. Plastic the life end of the century. People actin' fake can't see the omens. Wake up yourself cause change is comin'. There's a land by the sand grab the money. Hollywood is such a place fuelin' the frenzy. And everybody starts to peep around corners. Before they take their next step they know their borders.,ENGLISH

Than make up a set of goals and cold beat 'em. See dumb verbal tags like audio spaghetti. Give a shout to the one they call yeti. I bet he put the cabash on any foes whatsoever. Like original brodel Trevor. Positive vibe merchant grandson of Lord Buckley. Scotish ralston shows up if you're lucky. Ad raspler the sweed a friend in deed. He's keeping an eye on the other guy's gred. These are 311 characters I dubbed everyone. The story ain't over but my rhyme is done. It was the year that I first touched ground. So I grabbed the microphone and I got down. Just like James Brown gather round of our sight and sound. Pound for pound we throw down rather profound. I'll put you in another world I can't hear you. Like having phone sex with a deaf girl. No doubt we got the jams that'll smack ya. I penned three books of lyrics 2 for action 1 for backup. 'Cuz I'm a cold rockin' brother got transistor tunes. And it feels real good to get close to you. The brodels is the nazz and the nazz knows where it's at. The brodels is the nazz who knows a cat who can feed a cat. The goal is to be a poet and a carpenter. To be one who loves to be one who works. The nazz not something that can be given. The brodel is inside you it comes from within. When I feel into the sea. When the world came and kissed me. Transformed my shit told the shark I was a dolphin. Swam quick funny though. Parranahs chilled and laughed at. The way that I took off my polka dots on top of that. The wales know I'm quick watch out. And I get funky fresh as for the fishes I'm lit luminous. I'm not nouveau techno I glow like a glacial. In skin that swims faster than speed. I am I be dropped out of nothing I will return to nothing. Rotate my style my rhyme my way magician of a rythm. Lover of animals damn I wanna hear 'em. Aquatic my way I got soul shape. Well I'm 6 foot 3 and like Mohammed Ali. I float like a butterfly and sting like poison ivy. Drive a 69 lincoln suicide doors. Around the town I'm slinking fat subs of course. we're the greatest show on earth. You know we turn it out daily. In and out of town like Baarnum and Bailey. I know that is a simile but I couldn't resist. From Solomon Roadie for the PJ's. I don't think he'll be pissed. I eat a cobb salad, smoked fish, duck, or clam chowder. Chill with indica and Guinness. Steer clear of white powder. I run into my brother give him a pound and a yodel. They know my word is bond talkin' bout the brodels. The brodels is the nazz and the nazz knows where it's at. The brodels is the nazz who knows a cat who can feed a cat. The goal is to be a poet and a carpenter. To be one who loves to be one who works. The nazz not something that can be given. The brodel is inside you it comes from within. And we're fresh dude just check my man P. He said I will not muddle my mind with impertinency. Lost a lot in vegas plays a lot of Sega. Saw a phrase that he likes and put it on his leg. And we're fresh dude just check my man D he said. Comin' in ruff and tuff all systems are tweakin'. People all over the world they must be thinkin'.

So you piule inside the clunker start heading downtown. Only nineteen but you know where you can get it. So you slide inside the bar and everything is hitting. By about eleven o'clock your brain is near dead. You really can't remember who was the one that said. Let's go into the bathroom and meet this guy Chuck. He's got a thirty dollar white powder pick me up. Ten minutes later the whole vibe had changed. You try for conversation. But you know you're acting strange.

/ac-dc/,Back In Business,/ac-dc/back-in-business.html,"Breakin' out, about to shout. Feel the need for one more round. Don't you struggle, don't try to bite. You want some trouble, I'm the king of vice. I'm a wreckin' ball, I'm a stingin' knife. Steal your money, gonna take your life. You got screamin' murder, lock up your door. Double dealin' gotta have more. Call me dirty, trash my name. Just tell the boys that I'm gonna be. Back in business again. Back in business again. Back in business again. Back in business again. (Back in business). Flesh and blood, I'm a rag 'n' bone. Bad luck message on the telephone. Don't you worry, play my game. I'll do you a favor, got your soul for sale. I'm a cannon ball goin' down the track. Need good lovin' but I want it back. Born in trouble, they gave up on me. Teacher preachin' what not to be. Call me dirty, trash my name. Just tell the boys that I'm gonna be",ENGLISH
/ac-dc/,Back Seat Confidential,/ac-dc/back-seat-confidential.html,"Old man's car, it's Saturday night. Got me a woman, make me feel alright. Rock and roll at the drive-in show. Gonna sit in the back in the passion row. Turn up the soundtrack, turn down the lights. A chance she won't, a chance she might. Ain't no woman in the world I know. Ain't had her knickers on the automobile floor. What's that sound?. Something's going down. Look what's going 'round. Back seat confidential. Said to buy a rubber at the cigarette stand. Dying to get it off so I can get it in. Doing my best to make a good connection. She say what you gonna do 'bout my protection?. Alright mama gotta listen to me. Last chance thrill, it's half past three. Huggin' and kissin' would be real nice. Every man's got his price. What's that sound?. Something's going down. In the passion row. Back seat confidential. Old man's car, it's Saturday night. Got me a woman, make me feel alright. Rock and roll at the drive-in show. Gonna sit in the back in the passion row. Turn up the soundtrack, turn down the lights.

/ac-dc/,Bad Boy Boogie,/ac-dc/bad-boy-boogie.html,"On the day I was born. The rain fell down. There was trouble brewin' in my home town. It was the seventh day. I was the seventh son. And it scared the hell out of everyone. They said drop, I said go. They said fast, I said slow. They said yes, I said no. I do the bad boy boogie. Bein' a bad boy ain't that bad. I had me more dirty women than most men ever had. All you women come along with me. And I'll show you how good a bad boy can be. I said right and they said left. I said east and they said west. I said up and they said down. I do the bad boy boogie. All over town. I wouldn't tell you no story. Tell you no lie. I was born to love till the day I die. I just line em up. And I knock 'em down.
