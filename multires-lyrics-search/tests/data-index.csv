/10000-maniacs/,More Than This,/10000-maniacs/more-than-this.html,I could feel at the time. There was no way of knowing. Fallen leaves in the night. Who can say where they're blowing. As free as the wind. Hopefully learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. It was fun for a while. There was no way of knowing. Like a dream in the night. Who can say where we're going. No care in the world. Maybe I'm learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. There's nothing.,ENGLISH
/10000-maniacs/,Because The Night,/10000-maniacs/because-the-night.html,"Take me now, baby, here as I am. Hold me close, and try and understand. Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe. Love is a banquet on which we feed. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Cause the night belongs to us. Have I a doubt, baby, when I'm alone. Love is a ring a telephone. Love is an angel, disguised as lust. Here in our bed 'til the morning comes. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. With love we sleep,. with doubt the vicious circle turns, and burns. Without you, oh I cannot live,. forgive the yearning burning. I believe it's time to heal to feel,. so take me now, take me now, take me now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us",ENGLISH

And as you feel it,. You'll know it's true. That you - you are blessed and lucky. It's true - that you. Are touched by something. That will grow and bloom in you. These are days you'll remember. When May is rushing over you. With desire to be part of the miracles. You see in every hour. You'll know it's true. That you are blessed and lucky. It's true that you are touched. By something that will grow and bloom in you. These are days. These are the days you might fill. With laughter until you break. These days you might feel. A shaft of light. Make its way across your face. And when you do. You'll know how it was meant to be. See the signs and know their meaning. You'll know how it was meant to be. Hear the signs and know they're speaking. To you, to you",ENGLISH

/10000-maniacs/,Everyday Is Like Sunday,/10000-maniacs/everyday-is-like-sunday.html,"Trudging slowly over wet sand. Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen. This is a coastal town. That they forgot to close down. Armagedon - come armagedon come armagedon come. Everyday is like sunday. Everyday is silent and grey. Hide on a promanade. Etch on a post card:. How I dearly wish I was not here. In the seaside town. That they forgot to bomb. Come, come nuclear bomb!. Everyday is like sunday. Everyday is silent and grey. Trudging back over pebbles and sand. And a strange dust lands on your hands. (and on your face). Everyday is like sunday. Win yourself a cheap tray. Share some grease tea with me. Everyday is silent and grey",ENGLISH

Let me go on dreaming. How your eyes they glow so fiercely. I can tell your inspired. By the name you just chose for me. Now what was it?. O, never mind it. We will talk talk.

I looked to the clouds in the cirrus sky and they'd gone.. Across the marshes, across the fields below.. I fell through the vines and I hoped they would catch me below.. If only to take me with them there,. Tell me the part that shinesIn your heart on the wind.. And the reeds blew in the morning.. Take me along to the places. You've gone when my eyes looked away.. Tell me the song that you sing in the trees in the dawning.. Tell me the part that shines in your heart. And the rays of love forever,. Please take me there..",ENGLISH
