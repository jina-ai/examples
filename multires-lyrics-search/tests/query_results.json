Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Cause the night belongs to us. Have I a doubt, baby, when I'm alone. Love is a ring a telephone. Love is an angel, disguised as lust. Here in our bed 'til the morning comes. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. With love we sleep,. with doubt the vicious circle turns, and burns. Without you, oh I cannot live,. forgive the yearning burning.

Across the marshes, across the fields below.. I fell through the vines and I hoped they would catch me below.. If only to take me with them there,. Tell me the part that shinesIn your heart on the wind.. And the reeds blew in the morning.. Take me along to the places. You've gone when my eyes looked away.. Tell me the song that you sing in the trees in the dawning.. Tell me the part that shines in your heart. And the rays of love forever,. Please take me there..",
