## Use toy data

We have included 1000 lyrics as toy data in [`toy-data`](toy-data).
This data is ready to use with this example.

## [Optional] Download full lyrics dataset

**NOTE**: This is what is used in the Docker image and is **required** if you want to build it (the Docker image) yourself. 

If you want to use the full dataset, you can download it from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/neisse/scrapped-lyrics-from-6-genres).
To get it, once you have your Kaggle Token in your system as described in (https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api), run:

```bash
bash get_data.sh
```

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ``python app.py -t index`` | To index files/data |
| ``python app.py -t query`` | To run query on the index |
| ``python app.py -t dryrun`` | Sanity check on the topology |

## View in Browser

```bash
cd static
python -m http.server
```

Open `http://0.0.0.0:8000/` in your browser.

## Use Docker image from the jina hub

To make it easier for the user, we have built and published the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jinahub/app.example.multireslyricssearch) with 10000 indexed songs (more than the toy example, but just a small part of the huge dataset).
You can retrieve the docker image using:

```bash
docker pull jinahub/app.example.multireslyricssearch:0.0.2-0.9.20
```
So you can pull from its latest tags.

Then you can run it, and you can proceed to see the results in the browser as explained before

```bash
docker run -p 65481:65481 jinahub/app.example.multireslyricssearch:0.0.2-0.9.20
```


## üèÉ Run the Flows
Now that we've got the code to load our data, we're going to dive into writing our app and running our Flows!
### Index Flow
To run the index you type:
```bash
python app.py -t index
```
First up we need to build up an index and then search through this index when we use the query Flow later.
Then we have ready all the indexes!
### Query Flow
Now for the query time, run:
```bash
python app.py -t query
```

### With REST API

```sh
python app.py -t query_restful
```

Then:

```sh
curl --request POST -d '{"top_k": 10, "mode": "search",  "data": ["hello world"]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'http://0.0.0.0:45678/search'
````

Or use [Jinabox](https://jina.ai/jinabox.js/) with endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:45678/search`
