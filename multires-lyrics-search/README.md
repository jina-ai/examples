This example shows you how to build a semantic search app powered by [Jina AI](http://www.jina.ai)'s neural search framework.  You can index and search song lyrics using state of art machine learning language models. This example helps teach you about the concept of chunking and its importance in search systems. Once you've built the example, you can visualize how the system is matching inputs to output via a custom website we have built. 

# üêç Build the app with Python

These instructions explain how to build the example yourself and deploy it with Python. If you want to skip the building steps and just run the app, check out the Docker section below.  

## Pre requirements:
1. You have a working Python 3.7 or 3.8 environment. 
2. We recommend creating a [new python virtual envoriment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to have a clean install of Jina and prevent dependency clashing.   
3. You have at least 2GB of free space on your hard drive. 


## Step 1. Clone the repo and install Jina

Begin by cloning the repo so you can get the required files and datasets. 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/examples
cd examples/multires-lyrics-search
```

On your terminal,  you should now be located in the multires-lyrics-search folder. Let's install Jina and the other required Python libraries. For futher information on installing Jina check out our [documentation](https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/core/setup/). 

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If this command runs without any error messages, you can then move onto step two. 

## Step 2. Download your data to search 

You have two different options here. You can either use the toy-data we provide in this repo, which is quick to index but will give very poor results, or you can download a larger dataset, which takes longer to index, but you will see better results.  

### Toy dataset
Skip to step 3. No action needed here. 

### Full dataset 
Begin by installing the Kaggle library if you haven't already done so.  You will also need to setup your API keys as [explained here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#api-credentials) .
```sh
pip install kaggle
```

Running the following bash script should perform all the steps needed to download the full dataset. 

```bash
bash get_data.sh
```

## Step 3. Index your data

In this step we will index our data. When we run the following command, we call our index Flow and pass our data through it. The Flow begin by breaking each song into sentences, and then encoding those sentences using a language model. The data is then stored in an Indexer. 

```sh
python app.py index
```
If you see the following output, it means your data has been correctly indexed.
```sh
Flow@5162[S]:flow is closed and all resources are released, current build level is 0
```
## Step 4. Query your indexed data

Next, we will deploy our query Flow. This Flow will accept a search input, break in down into sentences and encode it using the same language model as above. It then performs a nearest neighbor search and find the most similar sentences in our indexer compared to the one you entered in the search input. 

Run the following command and leave it open and running in your terminal. 

```sh
python app.py search
```
Open a new terminal window and run the following command to launch the web interface. 

```bash
cd static
python -m http.server
```
Now you can open `http://0.0.0.0:8000/` in your browser and you should see a web interface. See the next section to understand your results. 

# Using the search interface and understanding your results
Let's begin by starting with a simple one-sentence query. For example, if you add the sentence 'I am very happy today; you should see a similar result. Each of these boxes you see on the right-hand side is a song in your dataset. Each highlighted sentence is a 'match.'  A match is a similar sentence, determined by how parallel two vectors are in embedding space.  If you don't understand the concept of embedding spaces, we suggest you check out this guide [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-network-embeddings-explained-4d028e6f0526) and then return to this example after.

Similarity can be adjusted using the breakdown slider on the left-hand side. As you move the slider to the right, you will see more matches appear. This is because we are increasing our radius in the vector space for finding similar matches. 

The relevance score you see at the bottom of the song box summarizes all the matches. Each match has a numeric value, determining how close it is to the original input in the vector space. The average of these match values is the relevance score. This means that a song with a lot of matches will be ranked as highly relevant. 

The example get's a little more complex if you use two or three sentences in the query box. In this case, the query Flow breaks the total input down into 'chunks', which are sentences, but you can adjust this when your building Jina yourself. Finding the relevance score also becomes more complex, but the same basic principle applies. A song with many similar matches will be ranked as relevant, and those without matches will not be.  


# Overview of the files in this example
Here is a small overview if you're interested in understanding what each file in this example is doing. 

* `toy-data/lyrics-toy-data1000.csv` - contains a small number of songs to test the example 
* `flows/index.yml` - contains the configuration details for indexing data
* `flow/query.yml` - contains the configuration details for querying data
* `pods/encode.yml` - specifies which executor should be used to encode the data
* `pods/chunk.yml` - specifies which executor should be used to chunk the data
* `pods/chunk_merger.yml` - specifies which executor should be used to chunk the data
* `pods/doc.yml` - specifies which executor should be used for indexing and config values for this executor. 
* `pods/ranker.yml` - specifies which executor should be used to rank the matches, and config values for this executor
* `pods/segment.yml` - specifies config values for the segmeneting of chunks
* `static/*` - contains the frontend interface
* `test/*` - various maintenance tests to keep the example running. 
* `app.py`  - the gateway code to combine the index and query flow 
* `get_data.sh` - downloads the Kaggle dataset.
* `requirements.txt` - contains all required python libraries
* `get_data.sh` - a simple bash script to get the larger dataset
