# Chinese Text Search with Transformers and bert-base-chinese [简体中文](README_CN.md)

| Table        | Content           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Input     | 1 text file with 1 sentence per line |
| Output     | top_k number of sentences that match input query| 
| Jina version | 1.0.0   |


This is an example of using [Jina](http://www.jina.ai)'s neural search framework to search through the first chapter of [Dream of the Red Chamber（ 红楼梦）](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber). It's based on code generated by `jina hub new --type app`. It uses the [`bert-base-chinese`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-chinese) language model from [Transformers](https://huggingface.co).

## Setup

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## First trial on a toy example

We'll start off by indexing a small dataset (`data/toy-data.txt`) to make sure everything is working:

```sh
python app.py -t index
```

```sh
python app.py -t query
```

## Index

To index the [full dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/noxmoon/chinese-official-daily-news-since-2016):

1. Set up [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#getting-started-installation-&-authentication)
2. Run the script: `sh ./get_data.sh`
3. Set the input file: `export JINA_DATA_FILE='data/chinese_news.txt'`
4. Set the number of docs to index `export JINA_MAX_DOCS=500` (or whatever number you prefer. The default is `50`)
5. Delete the old index: `rm -rf workspace`
6. Index your new dataset: `python app.py -t index`

## Search

### With REST API

```sh
python app.py -t query_restful
```

Then:

```sh
curl --request POST -d '{"top_k": 10, "mode": "search",  "data": ["text: 满纸荒唐言，一把辛酸泪"]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'http://0.0.0.0:45678/api/search'
````

Or use [Jinabox](https://jina.ai/jinabox.js/) with endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:45678/api/search`

### From the Terminal

```sh
python app.py -t query
```

## Build a Docker Image

This will create a Docker image with pre-indexed data and an open port for REST queries.

1. Run all the steps in setup and index first. Don't run anything in the search step!
2. If you want to [push to Jina Hub](#push-to-jina-hub) be sure to edit the `LABEL`s in `Dockerfile` to avoid clashing with other images
3. Run `docker build -t <your_image_name> .` in the root directory of this repo
5. Run it with `docker run -p 45678:45678 <your_image_name>`
6. Search using instructions from [Search](#search) above

### Image name format

Please use the following name format for your Docker image, otherwise it will be rejected if you want to push it to Jina Hub. 

```
jinahub/type.kind.image-name:image-version-jina_version
```

For example:

```
jinahub/app.example.wikipedia-sentences-30k:0.2.8-0.9.23
```

## Push to [Jina Hub](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-hub)

1. Ensure hub is installed with `pip install jina[hub]`
2. Run `jina hub login` and paste the code into your browser to authenticate
3. Run `jina hub push <your_image_name>`
